<p>custom works!</p>
<!-- gonna create a structural directive which will work just like ngIf directive -->
<!-- Attribute directives listen to and modify the behavior of other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components.

Structural directives are directives which change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM element.
like ngIf -->


<div>
    <button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="isAvailable = !isAvailable">
        Toggle the condition
    </button>
</div>
<div *appIf="isAvailable">
    This condition enables with custom structural directive
</div>

<!-- templateRef will come if we represent it as structural directive => [] -->
<!-- elementref will come if we represent it as attribute directive => * -->
